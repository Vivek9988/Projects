<P><H3>This one is so obvious, we’re going to look at it first. Paid search, social media advertising,
     and display advertising (try our Smart Ads Creator!) are all excellent ways of attracting visitors,
      building your brand and getting your site in front of people. Adjust your paid strategies to suit your goals 
      – do you just want more traffic, or are you looking to increase conversions, too? Each paid channel has 
      its pros and cons, so think carefully about your objectives before you reach for your credit card.
    If you’re hoping that more traffic to your site will also result in more sales, you’ll need to target high
     commercial intent keywords as part of your paid search strategies. Yes, competition for these search terms
      can be fierce (and expensive), but the payoffs can be worth it.</H3></P>

    <p><h1><p style="color: red;">2. GET SOCIAL</p></h1></p>
    <P><H3>It’s not enough to produce great content and hope that people find it – you have to be proactive.
         One of the best ways to increase traffic to your website is to use social media channels 
         to promote your content. Twitter is ideal for short, snappy (and tempting) links, whereas 
         Google My Business posts can help your site show up in local search results. If you’re a 
         B2C product company, you might find great traction with image-heavy social sites like Pinterest
          and Instagram. Here’s more advice on making the most of</H3></P>

          <p><h1><p style="color: red;">3.PAY ATTENTION TO ON-PAGE SEO</p></h1></p>
<P><H3>Think SEO is dead? Think again. Optimizing your content for search engines is still 
    a valuable and worthwhile practice. Are you making the most of image alt text? Are you
     creating internal links to new content? What about meta descriptions? Optimizing for on-page SEO doesn’t
      have to take ages, and it could help boost your organic traffic.</H3></P>

<P><H1><P style="color: red;">4.GO AFTER REFERRAL TRAFFIC</P></H1></P>
<P><H3>Rather than trying to persuade other sites to link back to you (a tedious and time-intensive process),
     create content that just begs to be linked to.
    When Larry wrote about the kick in the proverbial teeth that eBay took from Google’s Panda update,
     we managed to secure a link from Ars Technica in the Editor’s Pick section alongside links to The New 
     York Times and National Geographic. Not too shabby – and neither was the resulting spike in referral
      traffic. Learn what types of links send lots of referral traffic, and how to get them, in this post.

    <P><H1><P style="color: red;">5.POST CONTENT TO LINKEDIN</P></H1></P>
    <P><H3>LinkedIn has become much more than a means of finding another job. The world’s 
        largest professional social network is now a valuable publishing platform in its own right, 
        which means you should be posting content to LinkedIn on a regular basis. Doing so can boost 
        traffic to your site, as well as increase your profile within your industry – especially if 
        you have a moderate to large following.</H3></P>


        <P><H1><P style="color: red;">6.IMPLEMENT SCHEMA MICRODATA</P></H1></P>
    <p><H3>Implementing schema (or another microdata format) won’t necessarily increase traffic
         to your website on its own, but it will make it easier for search engine bots to find
          and index your pages. Another benefit of using schema for SEO is that it can result in 
          better rich site snippets, which can improve click-through rates.</H3></p>

        <P><H1><P style="color: red;">7.MAKE SURE YOUR SITE IS FAST</P></H1></P>
       <P><H3>Ever found yourself waiting thirty seconds for a webpage to load? Me neither.
            If your site takes forever to load, your 
           bounce rate will be sky high. Make sure that your pages are as technically optimized as 
           possible, including image file sizes,
           page structure and the functionality of third-party plugins. The faster your site loads, the better.</H3></P>

           <P><H1><P style="color: red;">8.FOSTER A SENSE OF COMMUNITY</P></H1></P>
           <H3>People want to speak their minds and weigh in on subjects they feel passionately about, so building
                a community into your site is a great way to start a conversation and increase traffic to
                 your website. Implement a robust commenting system through third-party solutions such as
                  Facebook comments or Disqus, or create a dedicated forum where visitors can ask questions.
                   Don’t forget to manage your community to ensure that minimum standards of decorum are met, however.</H3>
         

           <P><H1><P style="color: red;">9.MAKE YOURSELF HEARD IN COMMENT SECTIONS</P></H1></P>
           <H3>You probably visit at least a few sites that are relevant to your business on a regular basis,
                so why not join the conversation? Commenting doesn’t necessarily provide an immediate boost to 
                referral traffic right away, but making a name for yourself by providing insightful, thought-provoking 
                comments on industry blogs and sites is a great way to get your name out there – which can subsequently 
                result in driving more traffic to your own site. Just remember that, as with guest posting, quality and relevance
                 are key – you should be engaging with other people in your niche, not dropping spam links on unrelated websites.</H3>
           

           <P><H1><P style="color: red;">10.EXAMINE YOUR ANALYTICS DATA</P></H1></P>
           <H3>is an invaluable source of data on just about every conceivable aspect of your site, from your most popular pages
                to visitor demographics. Keep a close eye on your SEO metrics, and use this information to inform your promotional
                 and content strategies. Pay attention to what posts and pages are proving the most popular. Inspect visitor data
                  to see how, where and when your site traffic is coming from.
            And don’t forget Google Search Console!</H3>

           <P><H1><P style="color: red;">11.SUBMIT YOUR  CONTENT TO AGGREGATOR SITES</P></H1></P>
           <H3>Firstly, a disclaimer – don’t spam Reddit and other similar sites hoping to “hit the jackpot” of referral traffic,
                because it’s not going to happen. Members of communities like Reddit are extraordinarily savvy to spam disguised as legitimate links,
                 but every now and again, it doesn’t hurt to submit links that these audiences will find genuinely useful. Choose a relevant subreddit, 
                 submit your content, then watch the traffic pour in.</H3>

           <P><H1><P style="color: red;">12.RESEARCH THE COMPETATION</P></H1></P>
           <H3>If you haven’t used software like BuzzSumo to check out what your competitors are up to, you’re at a huge disadvantage. 
               These services aggregate the social performance of specific sites and content to provide you with an at-a-glance view
                of what topics are resonating with readers and, most importantly, making the rounds on social media.
                 Find out what people are reading (and talking about), and emulate that kind of content to bring
                  traffic to your website.</H3>
